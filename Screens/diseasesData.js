    bacterial_blight:'Brown spots on the margins of the cotyledons characterize plants infected early in the growing season. Young plants may be stunted and if the infection reaches the growing point, they may die. Symptoms in later growth stages include angular lesions, which begin as small yellow to brown spots on the leaves.',
    curl_virus:'This virus is transmitted by an insect vector from the family Aleyrodidae and order Hemiptera, the whitefly Bemisia tabaci, commonly known as the silverleaf whitefly or the sweet potato whitefly. The primary host for TYLCV is the tomato plant, and other plant hosts where TYLCV infection has been found include eggplants, potatoes, tobacco, beans, and peppers.',
    fussarium_wilt:'The fungal pathogen Fusarium oxysporum affects a wide variety of hosts of any age. Tomato, tobacco, legumes, cucurbits, sweet potatoes and banana are a few of the most susceptible plants, but it also infects other herbaceous plants.',
    healthy_corn:'No diseases detected.',
    healthy:'No diseases detected.',
    diseased_okra_leaf:'These spores adhere to the leaf surface and grow, becoming mycelia growth. This growth is present on the undersides of the leaves in the form of yellowing and brown spots. As the disease progresses, the leaves become dry and brown. Cercospora survives in plant residue left from hosts such as beet, spinach, eggplant, and, of course, okra. It is favored by warm, wet weather. The most serious outbreaks occur after a period of rainy weather. It is spread by wind, rain, and irrigation, as well as mechanical tool use.Read more at Gardening Know How: What Is Okra Leaf Spot: Tips For Treating Leaf Spot Of Okra https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/edible/vegetables/okra/treating-leaf-spot-on-okra.htm',
    fresh_okra_leaf:'The leaf is fresh and disease free.',
    apple_apple_scrab:'Apple scab is caused by the fungus Venturia inaequalis. It infects crabapples and apples (Malus spp.), mountain ash (Sorbus spp.), pear (Pyrus communis) and Cotoneaster (Cotoneaster spp.). The apple scab fungus has several host-specific strains that can cause disease on one type of plant but not any other. For example, the strain of V. inaequalis that infects mountain ash will only infect other mountain ash trees and will not infect crabapple trees.',
    apple_black_rot:'Large brown rotten areas can form anywhere on the fruit but are most common on the blossom end. The flesh of the apple is brown but remains firm.',
    apple_cedar_apple_rust:'In early spring, during wet weather, these galls swell and bright orange masses of spores are blown by the wind where they infect susceptible apple and crab-apple trees. The spores that develop on these trees will only infect junipers the following year. From year to year, the disease must pass from junipers to apples to junipers again; it cannot spread between apple trees.',
    apple_healthy:'The apple is healthy and it can be used to eat',
    blueberry_healthy:'The blueberry is healthy and it can be used to eat',
    cherry_including_sour_powdery_mildew:'Cause Podosphaera cerasi (formerly P. clandestina), a fungus that most commonly infects young, expanding leaves but can also be found on buds, fruit and fruit stems. It overwinters as small, round, black bodies (chasmothecia) on dead leaves, on the orchard floor, or in tree crotches. Some chasmothecia may be trapped in bark crevices. In spring as buds break, irrigation or rain releases ascospores and wind spreads them to young leaves. When the right combination of temperature and leaf wetness duration occurs, these ascospores start the first colonies of the season',
    cherry_including_sour_healthy:'Sour cherry (Prunus cerasus), also commonly called tart cherry, is a fruit. The Montmorency sour cherry is the most popular type grown in the U.S. Sour cherry fruit contains chemicals that might reduce swelling and act as antioxidants. Some sour cherry products are marketed for specific health purposes, but up to 97% of sour cherries grown are used in cooking and baking.',
    corn_maize_cercospora_leaf_spot_gray_leaf_spot:'Gray leaf spot (GLS) is a common fungal disease in the United States caused by the pathogen Cercospora zeae-maydis in corn. Disease development is favored by warm temperatures, 80°F or 27 °C; and high humidity, relative humidity of 90% or higher for 12 hours or more. Cercospora zeae-maydis overwinters in corn residue, allowing inoculum to build up from year to year in fields.',
    corn_maize_common_rust_:'The common rust fungus overwinters in the southern U.S. and Mexico. Urediniospores are blown north to the Midwestern Corn Belt in the summer and infection occurs in June or July. Young leaves are most susceptible to infection and pustules are more likely to form after corn silking. The disease favors cool temperatures (60 - 76 degrees F), heavy dews, about six hours of leaf wetness, and relative humidity greater than 95 percent.',
    infected:'Lesions can eventually expand to a more oblong or “cigar” shape. They may also coalesce to form large areas of necrotic tissue. There are several host-specific forms of E. turcicum. The most economically important host is corn, but other forms may infect sorghum, Johnson grass, or sudangrass. The most common diagnostic symptom of the disease on corn is cigar-shaped or elliptical necrotic gray-green lesions on the leaves that range from one to seven inches long.',
    corn_maize_northern_leaf_blight:'Lesions can eventually expand to a more oblong or “cigar” shape. They may also coalesce to form large areas of necrotic tissue. There are several host-specific forms of E. turcicum. The most economically important host is corn, but other forms may infect sorghum, Johnson grass, or sudangrass. The most common diagnostic symptom of the disease on corn is cigar-shaped or elliptical necrotic gray-green lesions on the leaves that range from one to seven inches long.',
    corn_maize_healthy:'The corn maize is healthy.',
    grape_black_rot:'Disease development is favored by warm and humid weather. Symptoms of black rot first appear as small yellow spots on leaves. Enlarged spots (lesions) have a dark brownish-red border with tan to dark brown centers. All cultivated varieties (American, French Hybrid or vinifera) of grapes are susceptible to infection by the black rot fungus. However, over the growing season, berries become resistant to black rot infections.',
    grape_esca_black_measles:'Grapevine measles, also called esca, black measles or Spanish measles, has long plagued grape growers with its cryptic expression of symptoms and, for a long time, a lack of identifiable causal organism(s). The name ‘measles’ refers to the superficial spots found on the fruit.',
    grape_leaf_blight_isariopsis_leaf_spot:'Scattered, somewhat angular, purple-brown spots on upper leaf surface. Corresponding, less conspicuous, brown spots on lower leaf surface. Corresponding, less conspicuous, brown spots on lower leaf surface. Numerous scattered, somewhat angular, purple-brown spots on upper leaf surface. Numerous scattered, somewhat angular, purple-brown spots on',
    grape_healthy:'The grape is healthy and disease free.',
    orange_haunglongbing_citrus_greening:'Huanglongbing (HLB) or citrus greening is the most severe citrus disease, currently devastating the citrus industry worldwide. The presumed causal bacterial agent Candidatus Liberibacter spp. affects tree health as well as fruit development, ripening and quality of citrus fruits and juice. Fruit from infected orange trees can be either symptomatic or asymptomatic. Symptomatic oranges are small, asymmetrical and greener than healthy fruit. Furthermore, symptomatic oranges show higher titratable acidity and lower soluble solids, solids/acids ratio, total sugars, and malic acid levels.',
    peach_bacterial_spot:'Bacterial spot is an important disease of peaches, nectarines, apricots, and plums caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. pruni. Symptoms of this disease include fruit spots, leaf spots, and twig cankers. Fruit symptoms include pitting, cracking, gumming, and watersoaked tissue, which can make the fruit more susceptible to brown rot, rhizopus, and other fungal infections.',
    peach_healthy:'The peach is healthy.',
    pepper_bell_bacterial_spot:'Bacterial spot develops most rapidly during periods of warm temperatures and prolonged wet conditions. The pathogen survives in and on seeds and in plant debris (McGrath & Boucher, 2012). Although persistence of debris and the pathogen depend on environmental conditions, it is very common for the pathogen to survive in debris for at least a year. However, once infected debris gets decomposed and the organism is exposed to soil, it cannot stay alive for more than a few weeks. Infected weeds and volunteer host plants also can be sources of inoculum.',
    pepper_bell_healthy:'The pepper bell is healthy and disease free.',
    potato_early_blight:'Early blight of potato is a common disease found in most potato growing regions. The disease is caused by the fungus Alternaria solani, which can also afflict tomatoes and other members of the potato family. Potatoes become infected with early blight when foliage has become excessively wet due to rain, fog, dew, or irrigation. Although not a terminal disease, severe infections can be fairly detrimental. In contrast to its name, early blight rarely develops early; it actually usually affects mature foliage rather than young, tender leaves.

    potato_late_blight:'The first symptoms of late blight in the field are small, light to dark green, circular to irregular-shaped water-soaked spots . These lesions usually appear first on the lower leaves. Lesions often begin to develop near the leaf tips or edges, where dew is retained the longest.',
    potato_healthy:'The potato is healthy.',
    raspberry_healthy:'The raspberry is healthy',
    soybean_healthy:'The soybean is healthy',
    squash_powdery_mildew:'White deposits develop on the top sides of leaves that make them look like they have been dusted with flour. As this fungal disease advances, leaves become grayish-green and become dry to the touch. Eventually these leaves turn brown and fall off. Powdery mildew is most likely to infect older plants that are beginning to decline after producing a crop. Warm temperatures between 70 and 80F (21 to 27C) favor cucurbit powdery mildew, but rainy weather is not required to trigger an outbreak.',
    strawberry_leaf_scorch:'Diplocarpon earlianum is a species of fungus that causes disease in strawberry plants called strawberry leaf scorch. The disease overwinters in plant debris and infects strawberry plants during the spring season when it is wet. The five main methods to reduce strawberry leaf scorch include: irrigation techniques, crop rotation, planting resistant and disease-free seeds, fungicide use, and sanitation measures. Control of strawberry leaf scorch is important because it is responsible for the majority of disease in strawberries. Diplocarpon earliana affects the fruit quality and yield of the strawberry crop',
    strawberry_healthy:'The strawberry is healthy',
    tomato_bacterial_spot:'Three bacterial diseases are common in Ontario tomato fields: bacterial spot, caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria; bacterial speck, caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato; and bacterial canker, caused by Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis. In Ontario, bacterial disease is present at some level every season, though not always at destructive levels. However, when conditions are optimal for bacterial disease, losses in marketable yield can be up to 60% in some fields.',
    tomato_early_blight:'The most common cause of dark spots on tomato leaves, early blight begins on the oldest leaves closest to the ground. The irregularly-shaped spots have concentric rings around their edges, sometimes with a dark dot in the center. Affected leaves gradually wither to brown and hang on the stems, while leaves higher up on the plant remain green and healthy. Early blight spreads fastest in humid weather when temperatures are between 80 and 85F (27-29C).',
    tomato_late_blight:'The first symptoms of late blight on tomato leaves are irregularly shaped, water-soaked lesions, often with a lighter halo or ring around them these lesions are typically found on the younger, more succulent leaves in the top portion of the plant canopy. During high humidity, white cottony growth may be visible on underside of the leaf , where sporangia form Spots are visible on both sides of the leaves. As the disease progresses, lesions enlarge causing leaves to brown, shrivel and die. ',
    tomato_leaf_mold:'The oldest leaves are infected first. Pale greenish-yellow spots, usually less than 1/4 inch, with no definite margins, form on the upper sides of leaves. Olive-green to brown velvety mold forms on the lower leaf surface below leaf spots. Leaf spots grow together and turn brown. Leaves wither and die but often remain attached to the plant.',
    tomato_septoria_leaf_spot:'At this time of year, symptoms of Septoria leaf spot are quite evident on tomato leaves. This disease usually appears on lower mature leaves, causing them to turn yellow then brown and wither. Diseased leaves show small circular spots (lesions) with black or brown margins. The center of these lesions eventually turns gray, with small black fungal fruiting structures (pycnidia) scattered throughout. Lesions may also occur on stems and petioles, but tend to be more elongated.',
    tomato_spider_mites_two_spotted_spider_mite:'The two-spotted spider mite is the most common mite species that attacks vegetable and fruit crops in New England. Spider mites can occur in tomato, eggplant, potato, vine crops such as melons, cucumbers, and other crops. Two-spotted spider mites are one of the most important pests of eggplant. They have up to 20 generations per year and are favored by excess nitrogen and dry and dusty conditions. Outbreaks are often caused by the use of broad-spectrum insecticides which interfere with the numerous natural enemies that help to manage mite populations. As with most pests, catching the problem early will mean easier control.',
    tomato_target_spot:'arget spot symptoms begin as small dark lesions which enlarges to form light brown lesions with concentric pattern and a yellow halo around it in the transplants. Lesions can be seen inside the canopy and the micro-climate favors the infection process. The lesions on infected plants can become very large and cover significant area of the leaf in the field. Fruit lesions while starts as small lesions can enlarges to form large lesions with cracked centers (X) in the field or in ripening stage or shipment that can lead to post-harvest fruit rotting.',
    tomato_tomato_yellow_leaf_curl_virus:'Tomato yellow leaf curl virus is not seed-borne. It is only transmitted by the whitefly, Bemisia tabaci, which is commonly found in tropical and sub-tropical regions, and in greenhouses in temperate areas. Plants become severely stunted and shoots become erect. Leaflets are reduced in size and pucker. Leaflets curl upwards, become distorted, and have prominent yellowing along margins and/or interveinal regions. Flowers wither.',
    tomato_tomato_mosaic_virus:'If plants are infected early, they may appear yellow and stunted overall. Mottled light and dark green on leaves.  Leaves may be curled, malformed, or reduced in size.  Spots of dead leaf tissue may become apparent with certain varieties at warm temperatures.',
    tomato_healthy:'The tomato is healthy and disease free',
